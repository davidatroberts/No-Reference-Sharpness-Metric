# No Reference Sharpness Metric
This is an image quality metric that detects the amount of blur contained in an image. This implements the algorithm as dislayed in:

'A No-Reference Objective Image Sharpness Metric Based on the Notion of Just Noticeable Blur (JNB)' (Ferzli, Rony. Karam, Lina J)

It only works with bmp files at the moment.
